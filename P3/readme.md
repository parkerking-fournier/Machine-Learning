COMP 551 Project 3 - Image Analysis

Objective: Devise a machine learning algorithm to automatically compute mathematical functions from images.

Note: Please retrieve the relevant .csv files from https://www.kaggle.com/c/comp551-modified-mnist/data and place them in the data directory.



________________________HOW TO RUN_______________________

1)Pickle the data

   a) Retrieve the relevant .csv files from https://www.kaggle.com/c/comp551-modified-mnist/data and place them in the data directory.

   b) Write the following in a command line prompt

         cd ~/ARBITRARY_PATH/comp551-project3-master

         python preprocess/pickle_data.py


2) Run the CNN predictor

   a) make sure to run in an (virtual) environment that supports tensorflow. Information regarding this is found at https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

   b) if using a virtual environment, activate it.

   c) The model number of the CNN must be changed every time it is re-trained.
   line 117:  model_fn=cnn_model_fn, model_dir="/tmp/comp551_convnet_model212")
      - change "/tmp/comp551_convnet_model212" to something else such as "/tmp/comp551_convnet_model213"

   d) Write the following in a command line prompt

          cd ~/ARBITRARY_PATH/comp551-project3-master
          python Convolutional-Neural-Net/predictCNN.py

3) Run the NN predictor

          cd ~/ARBITRARY_PATH/comp551-project3-master
          python neural-network/nn.py

____________DESCRIPTION OF DIRECTORIES AND FILES___________________

Directory: preprocess

    File: pickle_data.py
          This script reads in the data in csv form, preprocesses it, and saves it as a .pkl file. These are larger, but are    in the numpy array form so they are faster to read in. It saves the pkl files in the 'data' directory.

    File: image_processing.py
          This contains the methods for preprocessing the images used in pickle_data.py

________________________________________________________________
Directory: Convolutional-Neural-Net

    File: predictCNN.py
          This script reads in the pkl files, and trains a CNN. When it has finished training it will output a result file
          to the directory Convolutional-Neural-Net
