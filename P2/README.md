# COMP551-language-classifier

A language classifier, trained with data collected from the McGill COMP551 Fall2017 class.

To run, use 'script.py' in REPL or as script.
Naive bayes will estimate probabilities on 80% of training data and test on the other 20%. Accuracy will be printed to stdout.


To predict labels on custom data with Naive Bayes, use the "label_data" function in script.py. It will output a csv to 'naive_bayes_prediction.csv'
